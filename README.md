# Flashcard

"Using minimal existing code, build a React application that uses an API to CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE, LIST records stored by the API."

In order to implement this application, I underwent research on React Hooks, Bootstrap styling, and routing techniques. 

This was built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, React Hooks, & Bootstrap, giving me ample practice in rendering, managing state, calling external APIS, and using React Router. 

In future iterations, I hope to make this more intuitive with fresh colors, more seamless buttons and routing, as well as create the ability for multiple users to utilize this site and save their flashcards/decks.

**Project rubric**

All tests are passing in Qualified.

All the props are treated as read-only.

State is never directly mutated; it's only updated via setState().

The Edit Card and Create Card screens share the same form component.

The useEffect() hooks have the appropriate dependencies listed in the dependency array.

State is "lifted up" to the parent component where appropriate.

All inputs are controlled.
