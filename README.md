# Flashcard

"Using minimal existing code, create an app that allows users the ability to CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE, LIST decks of flashcards as well as individual cards."  

In order to implement this application, I underwent research on React Hooks, Bootstrap styling, and routing techniques. 

This was built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, React Hooks, & Bootstrap 

In future iterations, I hope to make this more intuitive with fresh colors, more seamless buttons and routing, as well as create the ability for multiple users to utilize this site and save their flashcards/decks.
